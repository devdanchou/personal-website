          <p>Welcome! I’m excited to share my journey of becoming a software engineer!
            <br>
            <br>I embarked on this journey in late 2022 after listening to a podcast during my evening commute from work. It discussed an engineer's career pivot from finance to tech, and I found the takeaways to deeply resonate with my own life goals. Intrigued, I decided to dabble in JavaScript, which proved to be both highly challenging and incredibly stimulating.
            <br>
            <br>Previously, I worked in finance, covering the fixed-income market for several years. I'm a lifelong New Yorker who, interestingly enough, isn't a Knicks fan (although they exceeded my expectations this past postseason). In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and spending time with my Frenchie, Beau.
            <br>
            <br>In July, I'll be attending Rithm, a software engineering bootcamp. I would love to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts who are also embarking on the same path!
